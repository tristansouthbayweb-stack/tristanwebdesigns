Subject: Window Cleaners: Your Best Work Is Invisible Online

Hi there,

You're out there making windows sparkle all over the Peninsula. But here's the irony: Your own business is basically invisible online.

When I search "window cleaning Palos Verdes," your competitors show up. You don't. That means they're getting the calls that should be yours.

I built you a website that actually converts:

👉 DEMO SITE: [Window cleaning site with quote requests and photo gallery]

What it includes:
• Before/after photo gallery (proves your quality instantly)
• Instant online quotes (capture leads 24/7)
• Service area pages for each city (SEO boost)
• Mobile design (people search on their phones)

Window cleaning is visual — people need to see results before they trust you. A website with photo proof beats a Yelp listing every time.

The demo is ready to launch. Want to see what your business could look like online?

P.S. — One good residential client in Palos Verdes pays for a website in their first month. How many are you missing?
