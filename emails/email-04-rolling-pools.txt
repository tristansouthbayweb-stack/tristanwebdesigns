Subject: Pool Service Companies Without Websites Are Losing Money

Hi there,

Quick question: How many new customers found you online last month?

If the answer is "not many," I can tell you why — when people search "pool service Rolling Hills," you're not showing up. At all.

I checked. Your competitors have websites. They have online booking. They have "request a quote" forms that capture leads while they sleep.

So I built you a professional pool service website:

👉 DEMO SITE: [Pool service site with booking and service areas]

Here's what it does:
• Shows your service areas (Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills, RPV)
• Lets customers book recurring service online
• Explains your packages clearly
• Builds trust with professional presentation

Pool service is recurring revenue — one new customer = thousands per year. How many are you losing to competitors with better websites?

The demo is ready. Let me know if you want to see it live.
