Subject: Home Organizers: Your Transformations Need a Gallery

Hi there,

I saw your Instagram posts — those before/after transformations are incredible! But Instagram isn't a website. Here's what you're missing:

• People can't find you on Google
• No way to book your services online
• Hard to explain your full service packages
• Looks less professional than competitors with real sites

I built you a proper business website:

👉 DEMO SITE: [Professional organizing site with transformation galleries]

What it does:
✓ Photo galleries that showcase your magic
✓ Service packages with clear pricing
✓ Online booking for consultations
✓ Testimonials that build trust
✓ Blog section for organizing tips (SEO boost)

Home organizing is emotional — people feel embarrassed about their clutter. Your website needs to feel welcoming, professional, and judgment-free.

The demo is ready. I specialize in websites for local service businesses in Palos Verdes. Let me know if you want to see it.

P.S. — The right client in Rolling Hills or Palos Verdes Estates pays $2K-5K+ for organizing. Your website should reflect that value.
