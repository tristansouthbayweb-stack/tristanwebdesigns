Subject: Handyman Services Need Better Websites (Yours Is Outdated)

Hi there,

I found your Angie's List profile, but honestly? It's outdated and doesn't do your business justice.

When homeowners in Rancho Palos Verdes need a handyman, they want to see:
• What services you actually offer
• Photos of completed work
• Real reviews from local customers
• Easy ways to request quotes

Your current profile doesn't give them that. So I built you something better:

👉 DEMO SITE: [Handyman site with services, gallery, and booking]

This includes:
✓ Clear service list (no more "do you do this?" calls)
✓ Project photo gallery (builds instant trust)
✓ Online quote requests (capture leads anytime)
✓ Service area map (Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills, RPV)
✓ Mobile-friendly (people search on phones)

The Peninsula has expensive homes that need quality work. Homeowners here research before they hire. A professional website makes the difference between "I'll call him" and "keep looking."

The demo is ready. Want to see what your business could look like?

P.S. — One kitchen repair in Palos Verdes pays for a website. How many jobs are you losing to competitors who look more professional online?
