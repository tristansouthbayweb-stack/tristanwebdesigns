Subject: Your Yoga Studio Needs a Real Website (Not Just Facebook)

Hi there,

Love what you're doing at Malaga Cove Yoga. The Peninsula needs more wellness spaces like yours.

But here's the thing: Your Facebook page isn't enough. When someone searches "yoga Palos Verdes" on Google, Facebook pages don't rank. You're invisible to new students.

I built a proper website for your studio:

👉 DEMO SITE: [Yoga studio site with class schedule and membership signup]

What this does for you:
✓ Class schedule that's always up-to-date
✓ Online membership signup (increase conversions)
✓ Instructor bios (builds community)
✓ Workshop & event listings
✓ Mobile-friendly (students check schedules on their phones)

Right now you're relying on students to remember to check Facebook. A proper website makes you discoverable 24/7.

The yoga market in Palos Verdes is growing. Make sure new students find YOU first.

Want to see the demo site?

Namaste,
Tristan
