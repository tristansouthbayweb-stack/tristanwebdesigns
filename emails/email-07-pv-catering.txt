Subject: Catering Businesses Need Real Websites (Here's Yours)

Hi there,

Planning a wedding or event in Palos Verdes? The first thing people do is Google "catering near me."

Right now, Palos Verdes Fresh Catering isn't showing up — or if you are, it's just a Facebook page. Event planners need more than that.

I built you a professional catering website:

👉 DEMO SITE: [Catering site with menus, galleries, and quote forms]

This gives event planners:
✓ Downloadable menus (PDFs they can share with clients)
✓ Photo galleries from past events
✓ Online quote requests (with event details)
✓ Service area & availability calendar
✓ Testimonials from happy couples

Facebook isn't enough for $10K+ catering contracts. Planners want to see professionalism, past work, and clear pricing. Your competitors have websites. You need one too.

The demo site is ready. Let me know if you want to see it.

P.S. — One wedding booking pays for this website many times over.
