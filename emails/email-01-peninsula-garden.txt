Subject: Your Landscaping Business Deserves a Better Online Presence

Hi there,

I was searching for landscaping services in Rolling Hills Estates and noticed Peninsula Garden Care doesn't have a website. That's actually costing you customers.

Here's why: When homeowners in Palos Verdes want landscaping, they Google first. If you're not showing up with a professional site, your competitors are getting those calls instead.

I build websites specifically for local service businesses like yours. Here's what I created for you:

👉 DEMO SITE: [I built a professional landscaping website showcasing your services]

This includes:
✓ Photo gallery to show off your best projects
✓ Online booking system (reduces phone tag)
✓ Mobile-friendly design (70% of local searches are on phones)
✓ Google Maps integration so customers find you

The Peninsula has high-value clients who judge businesses by their websites. Right now, you're invisible to them online.

I'd love to discuss making this demo site live for Peninsula Garden Care. No pressure — just want to show you what's possible.

Can we chat for 10 minutes this week?

Best,
Tristan
