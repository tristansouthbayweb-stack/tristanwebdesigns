Subject: I Found Your Pet Grooming Business — And a Problem

Hi there,

I was looking for a groomer for my dog in Palos Verdes and found your business. But when I tried to visit your website on my phone, it was... rough.

The site doesn't work on mobile, takes forever to load, and honestly makes it hard to trust the business. That's not fair to you — your grooming skills are probably amazing, but your site isn't showing that.

So I built you something better:

👉 DEMO SITE: [Modern, mobile-friendly pet grooming website]

What's different:
✓ Works perfectly on phones (where 70% of pet parents search)
✓ Online appointment booking (no more phone tag)
✓ Photo gallery of happy, freshly-groomed pets
✓ Service menu with clear pricing

Your current site is from 2015. Pet parents in 2026 expect more. They're comparing you to big chains like PetSmart — and right now, your website makes you look smaller.

I can fix that. Want to see the demo?
