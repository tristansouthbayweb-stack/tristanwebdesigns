Subject: Mobile Detailers Need Websites Too — Here's Yours

Hi there,

Saw your Instagram posts — your detailing work looks incredible. But here's the thing: Instagram doesn't show up in Google when someone searches "mobile car detailing Palos Verdes."

That means you're missing customers every single day.

I built a demo website specifically for South Bay Mobile Auto Detail to show you what's possible:

👉 DEMO SITE: [Professional auto detailing website with online booking]

Your customers could:
• See before/after photos of your best work
• Book appointments online (while you sleep)
• Get instant quotes based on vehicle type
• Find your service area and availability

The demo is ready to go live. I build sites for local service businesses in the South Bay, and I know the difference a professional site makes for converting browsers into bookings.

Want to see it? Let me know and I'll send you the link.

P.S. — This costs less than you'd think. Way less than the customers you're missing.
