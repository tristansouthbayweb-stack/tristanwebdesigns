Subject: Piano Teachers Need Websites Too — Parents Judge You By It

Hi there,

Parents in Palos Verdes take their kids' education seriously. When they search "piano lessons near me," they're comparing teachers online.

Right now, you're on Craigslist. That's... not ideal for $60-100/hour lessons.

I built you a professional teaching website:

👉 DEMO SITE: [Music lessons site with booking and student showcases]

What parents see:
• Your teaching philosophy & credentials
• Student performance videos/showcases
• Online lesson booking (no more email back-and-forth)
• Clear pricing & policies
• Testimonials from other parents

Parents want to trust who's teaching their kids. A professional website builds that trust before they even call you.

The Peninsula has affluent families who value music education. Make sure they find you — and take you seriously.

P.S. — One new student pays for this website in 2-3 lessons. How many are you missing?
